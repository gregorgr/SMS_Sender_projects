###
#  Network Interfaces
###

#  Sets the external interface.  This is the interface that will
#  face the Internet.  It's the one you want Firedoors firewall to
#  protect.  Typically it will be eth0 or eth1.  However, you
#  may choose to have Firedoors firewall automatically select the
#  * first * active interface it finds.  In this case, you would
#  use the key word, "auto" as in, EXTIF="auto".  This is usually
#  a good choice for users who have only one active network
#  interface on their machine.  Generally speaking, if you enable
#  the NAT routing features of Firedoors firewall, you really should
#  specify the external interface and not rely on auto-detection.
EXTIF="auto"

#  List the interface(s) that you would like to exclude from the
#  external interface auto-detection routine.  This is handy in
#  some instances where you may have multiple active network
#  interfaces that cannot be easily de-activated and may interfere
#  with external interface auto-detection (such as the virtual
#  network interfaces in vmware, etc.).  This option is only used
#  when the EXTIF setting above is set to, "auto."  For example,
#  if you wanted to blacklist interfaces eth3, vmnet1, and  vmnet2,
#  you would put, IF_BLACKLIST="eth3 vmnet1 vmnet2".  Most users
#  will leave this option blank.
IF_BLACKLIST=""


# setup a custom IP blacklist
# filename
IP_BLACKLIST="/etc/firedoors/firedoors-ip-blacklist"
# if yes IP blacklist will be applyed also when a firewall is stoped
# IP_BLACKLIST_ALWAYS="yes"
IP_BLACKLIST_ALWAYS=""

# TRUSTED IP LIST
# LIST of trusted IP addersses and ports for them
# TRUSTED_IP="xx.xx.xx.xx 192.168.0.0/24"
TRUSTED_IP="84.255.230.212 84.255.253.212 192.168.0.0/24"
TRUSTED_PORTS_TCP="23710 3355"
TRUSTED_PORTS_UDP="23710 3355"


#  Set the internal interface if you have one and want to be
#  able to pass all local traffic over it.  If not, then don't
#  specify an interface inside the quotes.  Just leave it blank
#  as in INTIF="".  This can NOT be set to, "auto!"
INTIF=""



##
#  Miscellaneous options set with, "yes" or, "no"
##

#  Disable the firewall (useful for temporarily disallowing
#  Firedoors firewall to start, without having to remove it from your
#  startup configuration).  This setting affects Firedoors firewall's
#  ability to start on boot-up but has no affect on the current
#  firewall state.  In other words, if Firedoors firewall has run
#  before setting this to disabled, the firewall rules and policies
#  will still be active until you either reboot, or issue the
#  following at the command line: 'sudo ubunti-firewall stop'
DISABLED="yes"

#  Firewall logging (useful for debug, curiousity, etc.)
#  This logs to syslog.
LOG_PACKETS="no"

#  Verbose mode (feedback during script execution)
#  This is useful for debug, extra feedback, etc.
VERBOSE="yes"

#  Respond to ICMP (echo-request) pings
ALLOW_PINGS="yes"



###
#  Complex Server options set with, "yes" or, "no"
###

#  FTP server - Firewall requirements for an FTP Server are a
#  little more involved.  Thus, I've coded support for it directly
#  into Firedoors firewall.  It can be enabled/disabled here.
ALLOW_FTP="no"

#  Micro$oft Networking - Firewall requirements for Micro$oft
#  Networking are a little more involved.  Thus, I've coded
#  support for it directly into Firedoors firewall.  It can be
#  enabled/disabled here.
ALLOW_MSNETWORKING="no"



###
#  Other services
###

#  List the TCP ports you want un-blocked by the firewall.  This applies to
#  THIS host only!  The ports need to be inside the quotes with a space
#  between each one. (ex: OPEN_TCP_PORTS="22 80 110")
#  This would un-block TCP ports 22 (ssh), 80 (http), and 110 (POP-3).
OPEN_TCP_PORTS="80 443"

#  List the UDP ports you want un-blocked by the firewall.  This applies to
#  THIS host only!  The ports need to be inside the quotes with a space
#  between each one. (ex: OPEN_UDP_PORTS="53")
#  This would un-block UDP port 53 (DNS Server services).
OPEN_UDP_PORTS="53"

# Prevent from DOS attack timeout new connections
DOS_BLOCK="yes"

# setup default DROP times for all ports in secconds
DOS_TIME_LIMIT_DEFAULT="30/minute"

# setup default DROP time for port apache port 80 and 443 in seconds
DOS_TIME_LIMIT_80_443="90/minute"

###
#  Advanced Options
###



#  Forwarding of Ports
#
#
#  You may establish forwarding to as many internal hosts as you like by
#  by following the established convention however, be sure not to forward
#  the same port to more than one internal host.
FORWARD_HOST1=""
FORWARD_HOST1_TCP=""
FORWARD_HOST1_UDP=""

FORWARD_HOST2=""
FORWARD_HOST2_TCP=""
FORWARD_HOST2_UDP=""

#  Custom Rules
#
#  This allows the user to define non-standard or custom rules to be added
#  to the firewall policy.  It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you only make
#  use of this if you understand iptables hirarchy and firewall design in
#  general!  Carelessly inserting rules into Firedoors firewall can easily
#  render it ineffective.  You have been warned!  Now, with all that out
#  of the way, here's how to do it.  First, you need to create a file that
#  contains the appropriate iptables commands, making certain that you have
#  the syntax correct.  When making your custom rules, you should probably
#  test each of them, one-at-a-time at the command prompt to verify that they
#  work as expected.  You may define as many custom rules as you like but
#  remember, usually the simpler the firewall ruleset, the more robust it
#  tends to be.  Take special care to make sure that any rules you define,
#  don't sabotage other rules listed below it.  Once you have your file
#  populated with your custom rules, save it and set the CUSTOM_RULES directive
#  to point to your file. Ex: CUSTOM_RULES="/etc/firedoors/firedoors-custom-rules"
#  If you don't have any reason to use custom rules, then simply leave
#  CUSTOM_RULES blank as in, CUSTOM_RULES="".
CUSTOM_RULES=""
