Ubuntu-firewall was first introduced in August 2005.  Since then, with
valuable feedback from the Ubuntu Community, it has evolved into a very
useful firewall and NAT-routing utility for Ubuntu Linux Boxes. It is now
being employed by hundreds of users from single PCs and small business
networks, to educational institutions.

---

14 August 2007 - version 0.9 contains a couple of minor bugfixes relating
to Ubuntu-firewall properly detecting if it is being executed with correct
privileges.  Also renamed the firedoors.sh init script to just,
"firedoors."  This seems to work better with the new upstart init
system that Ubuntu has gone to.  Added better user feedback when the
verbose option is used.

01 August 2007 - version 0.8 fixes a couple of very minor bugs which didn't
affect any of functionality.  It addressed a user feedback issue.

03 June 2007 - Version 0.7 has a more, 'intelligent' method of detecting
network interfaces and IP address settings.

08 February 2007 - Version 0.6 now supports port forwarding to more than one
internal host.  See Ubuntu-firewall's configuration file for details.  It
also supports a, "NAT only" configuration which allows you to configure
Ubuntu-firewall to work as a NAT routing gateway only.  In this mode, it
does no port filtering or blocking.

Beginning with version 0.5, Ubuntu-firewall will act more like other
system startup scripts.  Linux Standard Base init functions are now being
utilized by Ubuntu-firewall making it capable of showing up during the
boot-up process!  Along with some code clean-up, version 0.5 also makes an
attempt to support other Linux distributions instead of just exiting when
non Ubuntu systems are detected.

There are two ways to install Ubuntu-firewall.  Manually or with the in-
cluded installer script.  The installer script also has the ability to
remove Ubuntu-firewall from your system.  To install manually, proceed to
the paragraph entitled, "Manual Installation."  The procedure for
installation using the included installer script follows.


Installation Using the Installer Script:
Enter the directory in which the unpacked files for firedoors are
located.  You're probably already there if you're reading this!  Make sure
the installer script is executable and that you run it with root privileges.
Ex: 
"sudo chmod 755 firedoors-installer".  
To run it, simply type,
"sudo bash ./firedoors-installer".  

When the installer script finishes,
Ubuntu-firewall will be installed!  You'll have the opportunity to edit the
config file during the install.  If you decline to configure the config file
during the install, then you can do that afterwards.  Simply open up the
config file (/etc/default/firedoors-cfg) in your favorite text editor,
modify it to suit your system, and then save it.  Make sure to enable it as
Ubuntu-firewall is disabled in the config file by default.  Once this is
done, you can start Ubuntu-firewall by issuing the following at the command
prompt:  
"sudo firedoors start"  
See Ubuntu-firewall's man page for
more info (man firedoors). Ubuntu-firewall will start automatically on
subsequent boot ups.  You may remove this directory and all files contained
within, once the installer script finishes. The man page for Ubuntu-firewall
is accessible by typing, "man ubuntu-firewall" at the command prompt.


Extra Information Regarding The Installer Script (for those curious folks!):
When the installer script is run, it sets the appropriate attributes on the
firewall script and the config file,  copies them to their correct locations,
and adds Ubuntu-firewall as  a startup service  to run levels 2, 3, 4, and
5 with a start priority of 85.  It also makes an entry in a user-configurable
file for the DHCP client process, located in 
/etc/dhcp3/dhclient-exit-hooks
that accomodates dynamic IP configurations by having Ubuntu-firewall reload
itself when the DHCP client process acquires a new IP address lease.  If you
are upgrading from a previous version of Ubuntu-firewall, the script will
detect this and upgrade your version after making a backup of your old
configuration file. Starting with version 0.5, Ubuntu-firewall adds a man
page which can be accessed by typing, "man firedoors" at the command
prompt.  It also creates a symlink in /usr/bin called firedoors, which
points to the actual script (/etc/init.d/firedoors).   This makes it
easier and more convenient to manipulate firedoors from the command
line.  If/when firedoors is ever removed using the installer script,
all traces of firedoors will be removed including any symlinks and man
pages - it's tidy and cleans up after itself! :-)



Manual Installation: The installer script method is highly recommended but
if  you prefer  to do it manually, the following  steps will accomplish it.
The  firewall script  itself (firedoors) should  be placed within your
/etc/init.d directory.  It needs NO editing as all user-defined options are
located within the accompanying configuration file. Ubuntu-firewall should be
owned by root and in group root. It also needs to be executable.

Ex: "sudo chmod 755 firedoors"

The config file (firedoors-cfg) needs to be placed in your /etc/firedoors/
directory.  It's commented very well and is easy to configure.  Simply open it
up in your favorite text editor, modify it to suit your system, and then save
it.  To have firedoors start as a service at boot time, use the
update-rc.d tool to add it to the desired run level(s).  For example, to have
it startup in run levels 2, 3, 4, and 5, just issue the following command at
the command prompt:
"sudo update-rc.d firedoors start 85 2 3 4 5 . stop 20 0 1 6 ."

If you are configured to use DHCP to acquire your IP address settings, then you
need to add a line to your /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-exit-hooks file which will cause
the DHCP process to reload Ubuntu-firewall upon acquiring a new IP address lease.
To take care of this, simply run the following command at the prompt:

"sudo echo '/etc/init.d/firedoors reload' >> /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-exit-hooks"

Make sure that file is executable by running the following command at the prompt:

"sudo chmod 755 /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-exit-hooks" 
 If you want the man page for
Ubuntu-firewall, you can install it to your /usr/share/man/man1 directory.  The
man page is included and is called, 'firedoors.1.gz'  It is viewable by
typing, "man firedoors" at the command prompt.  For added convenience and
continuity with the man page, you should also create a sym link in your /usr/bin
directory called, "firedoors", which points to the actual script
(located at /etc/init.d/ubuntu-firewall).  This can be accomplished by issuing
the following command at the command prompt:
"sudo ln -s /etc/init.d/firedoors /usr/bin/firedoors"  
This also
makes it much easier to manipulate Ubuntu-firewall from the command line!  After
you have edited Ubuntu-firewall's config file for your system, you can manually
start it by doing the following at the command prompt: 
"sudo firedoors start"
That's it!  Your system is now being protected by Firedoors!  Once you've
copied or moved the files to their appropriate locations, you may remove this
directory and any remaining files contained within.


Extra Misc. Info:
Ubuntu-firewall is designed to be called directly by the init processes.  It
takes standard arguments (start, stop, reload, status, lockdown, and ver) and
may be manually invoked or shutdown on-the-fly.  It has support for Micro$oft
Networking, FTP, and whatever other TCP/UDP ports you wish to leave accessible.
It also supports Network Address Translation with routing so that it can act
as a router for a local area network or other PC.  Ubuntu-firewall can be
configured to do port forwarding to one or more internal host(s).  Also, it
can accomodate custom rules with the, "CUSTOM_RULES" directive in the
configuration file.  Use with care! :-)

Enjoy!
